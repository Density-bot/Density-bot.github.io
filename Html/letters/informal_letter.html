		Dear Dad,

	<p class="indent">
		I have been so choked up with activities lately at school that's why i have been unable to reply your letter. How have you been doing lately? I trust God that you are doing fine.
	</p>

	<p class="indent">
		I started my I.T last Monday and i bless God it has been going well. We were separated into different batches and i belong to Batch B. I have learnt alot these past few days ranging from preliminary study of Web designing to the learning of tags, elements, attributes and so much more. It has been so much fun!
	</p>
	<p class="indent">
		But in all, i have been stressed out with other activities and i don't even have food and money at hand anymore. I will be glad if you can send something to me. Thanks a lot sir, my regards to mum and my siblings.
	</p>
	<p class="align-right">
		Yours sincerely, <br>
		Destiny.
